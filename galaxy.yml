# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories
# that should not be included in the build artifact. A pattern is matched from
# the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files
# like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered.
#
# Mutually exclusive with 'manifest'.
build_ignore:
  - '*molecule/*'  # Do not include molecule testing in release.
  - 'ansible.env'  # development ansible environment.
  - '.ansible'  # ansible collection cache for role testing.
  - '.vscode'  # VSCodium settings.
  - 'TODO.md'  # development staging todo messages.
  - 'COMMIT.md'  # development staging commit messages.
  - 'plugins/**'  # TODO(collection): until plugins are actually added.
